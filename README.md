Problems Compiling?
========

OS Requirements
--------

Gears has been known to be able to compile in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. All other versions have not been tested. Gears is not tested to be compiled or ran on any other OS, including but not limited to MAC OSX, or any flavor of Unix/Linux, even with Mono.

Software Requirements
--------

Make sure you have all of the required parts:

* Visual Studios 2010 for C# (Express edition is fine)
* XNA 4.0
* .NET Framework 4.0
* The following font installed: https://github.com/spectrumbranch/gearsvge/blob/master/_DUMP/RosesareFF0000_0.ttf
* * Looking to remove the dependency of the font.

Visual Studios Tweaks
--------

Certain configurations may need to be made in Visual Studios if errors are encountered, especially directly after obtaining the source code.

* Check to make sure Solution Platform is x86, NOT Any CPU or x64.
